# Video Files

Please upload the following video files to this directory:

1. `Controller.mp4` - First controller animation
2. `Controller3.mp4` - Second controller animation
3. `Controller4.mp4` - Third controller animation
4. `gamer.mp4` - Main gamer video for the modal
5. `gamer.mov` - Backup format for gamer video

## Important Notes

- Video files should be optimized for web use (compressed, reasonable file sizes)
- All videos will autoplay and loop (except the gamer video)
- Videos are muted by default for autoplay compliance
- Recommended: Use MP4 format with H.264 codec for best browser compatibility

## GitHub File Size Limits

- GitHub has a 100MB file size limit per file
- If your videos are larger, consider:
  - Compressing them using tools like HandBrake or FFmpeg
  - Hosting them on a CDN or video hosting service
  - Using Git LFS (Large File Storage)
